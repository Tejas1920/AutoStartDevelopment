# Problem
As a fullstack developer its everyday stuff that we come to our system then we open .net Web API project and Run It 
Then we search angular project through windows explorer and open it in VS Code
Then we type cmd in the addressbar and type ng serve to run the Angular project
And Then we start our development
Very Time Consuming

This repo is the solution to that problem
Just come to your system
Open the system and run one file
Which will do all the above for you

# Step 1
Download Start.cmd and Start.ps1 files

# Step 2 
  - Open Start.ps1
  - Update Visual Studio Path to your relevent path
  - Update Solution Path to your relevent path
  - Save the file

# Step 3
  - Open Start.cmd
  - Update Angular Project Path to your relevent path
  - Save the file

# Congratulations You are Done
  - Double click on the Start.cmd

# What will it do?
  - It will open your .net solution in Visual Studio
  - It will run the project in debug mode (You must have set any project as start up project)
  - It will open your Angular Project in Visual Studio Code
  - It will run your Angular Project in a separate command prompt
  - It will open Angular project in default browser
